## Requirements

### Programs

1. VS Code
2. Make
3. Node
4. NPM

### Miking

To be able to run this, two changes to the Miking codebase is needed:

* Remove custom colored output for Miking errors.
* Remove printing of dots when utests pass.

[You can use this branch of Miking](https://github.com/didrikmunther/miking/tree/didrik/miking-lsp-demo-changes)

## Usage

1. `make all`
2. Press `F5` in VS Code
3. Open any MCore file
4. Try changing float values to integer values to see diagnostics

## How it works

<img src="mikinglspdemo.png" alt="Miking LSP" height="200"/>

1. The user opens a plaintext file in VS Code.
2. The LSP client eventually sends a `textDocument/didChange` notification to the LSP client.
3. The Miking LSP server parses the message, compiles the code, and sends a `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notification with the results to the client.
4. The LSP client forwards the message to VS Code, which displays the diagnostics.

*The RPC header consists of the line `Content-Length: <n>`, describing the length of the JSON body.

## Limitations

- The Miking LSP server doesn't support all LSP features, only the ones needed for this demo.
